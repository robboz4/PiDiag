Debug commands for setting up a Pi

I created this script to capture information people ask for when you are askiing for help in setting up a Pi or Octopi.
The output has xml tags to seperate the different commnands and their outputs. This isn't working on browsers yet
due to a format issue. It scrunches the command output. But looking into that.
Downlaod the script and chmod +x for exuction and it should run. The output file is names DiagoutYEARSECONDS.txt 
THE TEARSECONDS is automatically appended to give a somewhat unique file name. I will probably fix that later
but was in a rush to test and send the output to someone who is helping debug an issue.

Future:
1) Fix format fro browsers.
2) Pass in runtimeprameters to select the different or all commands.
3) add new commands that are useful.
